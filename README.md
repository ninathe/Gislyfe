# GISLYFE
This is a project made as part of the course TBA4251 Programming in Geomatics at Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU). The application is meant to be an introduction to geographic data processing. Users can upload data from geojsons, or use already included layers to do simple geoprocessing on the data.

## Built With
- React and Redux
- Mapbox GL JS 
- Turf
- Material-UI

## Functionality
- Buffer
- Difference
- Intersection (Between polygons)
- Upload new layer (GeoJSON)
- Edit styling of layer

NB:
The filename extension must be '.json' and not '.geojson'. Simply renaming the file will make it work.
